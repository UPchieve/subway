Local Development
-----------------
### Docker Use
Docker provides an alternative for local development. A Dockerfile and specific run script exist. Here's how to leverage them. With Docker installed, checkout this repository and navigate into its root directory.

1. Run `docker build -t local_upchieve_server/local_upchieve_server:0.1 . --rm` to create the image.
2. Run `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3001/tcp local_upchieve_server/local_upchieve_server:0.1 bash /bin/docker_run.sh` to launch the server
3. After any change: In the Dockerfile, change the line `ARG FOO=BAR` to something like `ARG FOO=BAR1`, changing "BAR" to anything different from the last run. Then, repeat steps 1 and 2, which should run much quicker.


### Dependencies

The recommended tool for runtime version managment is [`asdf`][asdf]. To use `asdf` on Windows, first install the appropriate Linux shell distribution using [`WSL`][wsl] (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

Install the following asdf plugins:

1. Node.js (see version listed in `.tool-versions`)
2. MongoDB (see version listed in `.tool-versions`)

- [`asdf-nodejs`][asdf-nodejs]

```shell-script
asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
bash ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring
asdf install nodejs [VERSION]
```

- [`asdf-mongodb`][asdf-mongodb]

```shell-script
asdf plugin-add mongodb https://github.com/UPchieve/asdf-mongodb
asdf install mongodb [VERSION]
```

[wsl]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
[asdf]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
[asdf-nodejs]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs
[asdf-mongodb]: https://github.com/UPchieve/asdf-mongodb

### Setup

1. Start a local MongoDB server by running `mongod`. In a separate terminal, you can try connecting to the database by running `mongo` (`mongod` to start the database vs. `mongo` to connect via command line!). Run `quit()` to exit the shell. You can also interface with the database using a free MongoDB GUI such as [MongoDB Compass Community](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Run `bin/setup` to set up the database with test users and install dependencies.
   Run with `--verbose` to debug if needed.
3. Run `node init` to add "questions" collection to database
4. If you want to test Twilio voice calling functionality, set the `host` property to `[your public IP address]:3000` (minus the brackets), and configure your router/firewall to allow connections to port 3000 from the Internet. Twilio will need to connect to your system to obtain TwiML instructions.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server on `http://localhost:3000`. If you get a [`bcrypt`][bcrypt] compilement error, run `npm rebuild`.
6. See [the web client repo](https://github.com/UPchieve/web) for client
   installation

[bcrypt]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt

### Test Users

The database is populated with the following users for local development:

| email                     | password      |
|:--------------------------|:--------------|
| `student1@upchieve.org`   | `Password123` |
| `volunteer1@upchieve.org` | `Password123` |
| `volunteer2@upchieve.org` | `Password123` |

By default, none of the test users have an `approvedHighschool` set.

Structure
---------

The root folder of the repository provides the bootstrap file `main.js` and a
package definitions file.

### config.js

`config.js` contains a map of configuration keys for running the server. All
keys and sensitive information should be placed in this file.

### models

Model definitions that map to database models, along with related methods to act
on those models, such as parsing, validation, and data transformations.

### router

Directory structure mimics the endpoint structure exposed by the server. Each
file provides one or more endpoint routes, responsible for request
acceptance/rejection and error handling.

### controllers

Routes use controllers to perform the business logic of the server, providing
separation of concerns: the controllers have no need to be aware of how the
endpoints work. Instead, a controller provides ways to allow the routes to
trigger something (a user update, e.g.)

### services

A service is a step higher than a controller. Services provide abstract
functions to one or many controllers, often to interface with third party
services.

Endpoints
---------

### POST /auth/login

Expects the following request body:

```json
{
  "email": "String",
  "password": "String"
}
```

Authenticates the user with a session if credentials are correct.

### GET /auth/logout

Removes the user's current session.

### POST /auth/register/checkcred

Check whether the credential user entered is valid. (first step of registeration)
The server will check is there any duplications for email and validate the password.

  "password": "String"
}
```

Possible errors:

- Email/password not provided

  "firstName": "String",
  "lastName": "String"
}
```

Possible errors:

- Email/password not provided
- Password does not meet requirements
- Email is not valid
- Email already exists
- Could not hash password
- Could not send verification email (for volunteers)

### POST /auth/reset/send

### POST /api/volunteers/availability

Returns a map with the availability of all the volunteers. All the keys are user ids.

If there are no errors, the response body contains the list of schools matching the search string in the format:

```javascript
{
  "results": [
    {
      "upchieveId": "UPchieve ID",
      "name": "high school name",
      "districtName": "district name",

}
```

### POST /school/check
