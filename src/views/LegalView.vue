        >
          <p>
            <strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION -- VENUE.</strong> You agree to be
            subject to the jurisdiction of New York. You agree that any dispute
            between you and us will be resolved in New York County, New York to
            the exclusion of any other potential venue.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS; NO JURY TRIAL.</strong> You agree that you
            will only sue us as an individual in any dispute connected with the
            Services. You agree that you will not file a class action or
            participate in a class action. You agree that you will not join any
            claim you may have against us with the claim of any third party. You
            waive any right to a trial by jury.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong> You and we agree that, at the
            election of either party, any dispute connected with Services
            between us may be sent to binding individual (non-class) arbitration
            to be administered by JAMS, Inc. ("JAMS"). If, for any reason, JAMS
            is not available or will not hear the case, you or we may file our
            case with any national arbitration company. You and we agree that
            the arbitrator shall not have any power to consider, hear,
            entertain, or grant any class arbitration.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>STANDARD OF CARE.</strong> You agree that our sole
            obligation to you in connection with the Services is to provide the
            Services as-is. You agree that unless we do something that is
            grossly negligent or an act of willful misconduct in connection with
            the Services, we will not be liable to you or to any third party.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.</strong> If, for any reason, we
            are judged liable to you in connection with the Services, you agree
            that your recovery will be limited to your actual damages, measured
            by actual out-of-pocket economic loss. You agree that you will not
            ask for any consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages,
            or indirect or lost profits. You agree that even if you request
            these types of damages, a court or arbitrator cannot award them to
            you. You understand and agree that the price of these Services would
            be significantly higher but for these limitations on liability. This
            limitation on liability shall not be construed to apply to any
            damages or other substantive remedies available via statute.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.</strong> You
            also agree that we are not responsible for anything beyond our
            control. For example, we are not liable: for Service interruptions
            caused by problems with the communications network; for problems
            caused by any Internet service provider; for your computer or its
            programs failing; for the acts of criminal attackers, whether in
            real-time or automated (e.g., viruses); for other technologically
            harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer
            programs, data or proprietary material due to your use of the
            Websites or to your downloading of any content on it, or on any
            website linked to it; or for errors in information provided to us
            upon which we reasonably rely. These are only examples. We assume no
            responsibility for the content of other websites linked on the
            Website. Such links should not be interpreted as an endorsement by
            us of those linked websites. We will not be liable for any loss or

              Services, and how long your interactions with other Users last.

          <p>
            Information collected is hosted in the U.S. and subject to U.S.
            state and federal law. Users who access our Services from other
            jurisdictions transfer their information to the United States, where
            data protection and privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws
            of the originating country.

            You can visit the Profile section of our Website at any time to see
            some of personal information we have collected about you. Most of
            this information can be updated by you on the Website, but you may
            email us at
            <a href="mailto:support@upchieve.org">support@upchieve.org</a> at
            any time to request that we update or remove your information.
            UPchieve will retain the information of Users for as long as your
            account remains active or until we receive a data deletion request
            from you.

          <p>
            If you are under age 13, a law called the Children's Online Privacy
            Protection Act (COPPA) says that we must have a parent's permission
            before we may collect and use your personal information. At this
            point, we do not allow students under the age of 13 to make accounts

            Now you know how and why we collect information - but who actually
            has access to it? Don't worry - UPchieve gives other Users and
            UPchieve staff members limited access to your information. In
            particular:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>UPchieve Staff Members:</strong> Only two staff members,
              the Executive Director and the Director of Technology, will be
              able to access all of the information connected to your account.
              Other UPchieve staff members may receive your name, email address,
              and any additional information you submit, should you use one of
              the forms on our Website (such as the “Contact Us” form) in order
              to respond to your message. Members of UPchieve’s Operations team
              may access specific information connected with your account for
              purposes such as screening chat logs or consolidating information
              to provide to the partner organization that referred you (if any)
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Other Users:</strong> Other Users may only view your first
              name and the help topic associated with the current session while
              you are in a session with them. After ending the session, the
              other User may no longer view any information about you or contact
              you. Providing personally identifiable information or contact
              information (such as your full name or your email address) to
              another User through the website is a breach of our Terms of
              Service. Furthermore, we strongly encourage all Users to follow
              internet safety practices and use caution even when interacting
              with other Users. For more information on best internet safety
              practices specifically for teens, check out WebMD's article.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Partner Organizations:</strong> If you were referred by a
              partner organization, we may share information regarding your
              usage of the app, such as how many times you used our Services,
              with that partner. This information will not be anonymized.

            <strong>
              Completely anonymized and consolidated information

            will be shared in our annual reports (which will be available on our
            Website to all visitors) and in our applications for funding.
            Anonymized and consolidated means that the information will not
            pertain to any one individual and it will not be possible to
            identify any individuals that may or may not be included. For
            example, we may share statistics such as X percent of students who
            used our services were the first in their family to attend college
            or Y percent of students said they thought our services were
            helpful. If you would like to be excluded from these statistics,

            On occasion, we may also ask for your permission to quote feedback
            from one of your submitted feedback forms. However, we will never

            unenforceability will not affect any other provision or the
            enforcement of such provision, and such invalid, void or otherwise
            unenforceable provisions shall be null and void. To the fullest
            extent permitted by law, any invalid, void or otherwise enforceable
            provisions shall be automatically replaced by other provisions which
            are as similar as possible to such terms but are valid and
